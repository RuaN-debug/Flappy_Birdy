# Flappy Birdy

Flappy bird used to be the game that made people really mad by playing it, because of its difficulty. It was created by the vietnamese Dong Nguyen. The game is pretty simple, you have to tap space in order to keep the bird flying and avoiding to hit the pipes.

# Development

I created this version of the game by following the tutorial of the channel Clear Code (https://www.youtube.com/ClearCode), with the video https://youtu.be/UZg49z76cLw
